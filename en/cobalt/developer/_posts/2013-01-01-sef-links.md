There are 2 ways to get your own SEF style. 

1. Integrate with SEF extensions like Artio, sh404, ...
2. Create your own router.

### Own Router

You know that joomla has core `router.php` file in component root. In order to be able to make changes without losing them on Cobalt update you may create your router just like you would do in `router.php` and save it in `components/com_cobalt/routers/`. Then you will be able to select this router in Cobalt global configuration.

![select](http://serhioromano.s3.amazonaws.com/mintjoomla/tutorial-customtmpl/router.png)

This tutorial is not intended to teach you how to write Joomla router. It only provide you required information to create one.

### Integration with SEF extension

Integrations are done by us or third party or SEF extension developers. This is best case scenario. Because SEF extension developers know best how to write integration yet they usually know what URLs are the best.

### Specification

If you are the 3PD developer or SEF extension developer and you want to create good SEF for Cobalt, here is the specification of Cobalt URLs.

Note all parameters are passed like this

	index.php?option=com_cobalt&view=records&section_id=5:children2&cat_id=4:test&Itemid=490

It means that you already have alias with category ID and section ID and other parameters. This is done to lower server load on SEF. 

#### Items Store

On of the most useful helper in Cobalt API is `ItemsStore` class which allow you quickly get record, section, category or type object.

Sometimes there is no data and you can retrieve it like this.

	require_once JPATH_ROOT.DS.'components'.DS.'com_cobalt'.DS.'library'.DS.'php'.DS.'helper.php';
	
	$record = ItemsStore::getRecord($record_id);
	$section = ItemsStore::getSection($section_id);
	$type = ItemsStore::getType($type_id);
	$category = ItemsStore::getCategory($cat_id);

But you have to check and retrieve data only if there is not alias in parameter already. 

<div class="box-warning">If there is data do not run additional query because we want Cobalt to work quick even with SEF.</div>

There are 2 main urls that require SEF. Other may be integrated but we do not think anyone will benefit of them in terms of SEO.

#### 1. Records list

Parameter | Core 	  | Description
----------|-----------|-------------------
setion_id | ![Yes][1] | ID of the section
cat_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the category
user_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the user

If we have `user_id` in the URL then we may have these additional parameters

Parameter | Core 	  | Description
----------|-----------|-------------------
ucat_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the category or the user.
view_waht | ![Yes][2] | What to show. This is a text variable. For example show created records or bookmarked. 

Example URLs

	index.php?
		option=com_cobalt&
		view=records&
		section_id=5:children2&
		user_id=46:sergey&
		Itemid=490
	
	index.php?
		option=com_cobalt&
		view=records&
		section_id=5:children2&
		user_id=42:admin&
		view_what=follow&
		Itemid=490

#### 2. Record

Parameter | Core 	  | Description
----------|-----------|-------------------
id		  | ![Yes][1] | ID of the article
cat_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the category
user_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the user

Example Url

	index.php?
		option=com_cobalt&
		view=record&
		user_id=46:sergey&
		id=72:test-download-pay&
		Itemid=490

#### 3. Post new article

Parameter | Core 	  | Description
----------|-----------|-------------------
section_id| ![Yes][1] | ID of the section
cat_id	  | ![Yes][2] | ID of the category
type_id	  | ![Yes][1] | ID of the content type


Example URL

	index.php?
		option=com_cobalt&
		view=form&
		section_id=5&
		type_id=6:another-child&
		return=aHR0cDovL2pvb21sYTI1L2lu…&
		Itemid=490
	

### Not SEF important

As I mentioned there are other URLs like category manager, Moderator manager, … But those links are accessible only by Registered users. So SEO does not benefit of good SEF on those links. If you do those you only do it for the beauty. But we believe Joomla core SEF createed links are ok for those pages. 

#### 3. Edit article

Parameter | Core 	  | Description
----------|-----------|-------------------
id		  | ![Yes][1] | ID of the article

Example URL

	index.php?
		option=com_cobalt&
		view=form&
		id=72-Test%20download%20pay&
		return=aHR0cDovL2pvb21sYT…&
		Itemid=490
