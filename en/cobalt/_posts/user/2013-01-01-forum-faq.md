## Q: How do I disallow public users to post in the forum?

In fact you have to know that this is not recommended. There is a war for users in internet. The one of the key to success is not abuse your users. And asking for registration just to post message or to say something in comments I consider to be an abuse. You have to have very strong reasons to **force** everyone to register.

If I have not convinced you or you have that strong reason, open _Topic_ type settings and change _Who can submit_ to _Registered_
