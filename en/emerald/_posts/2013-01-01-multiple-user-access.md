MUA (Multiple users access) allows to share one subscription between few customers. This is an enterprise Emerald feature. This is for subscribers, usually companies, who whats to have few employees access use the same subscription but each under his own account.

## How It Works

1. In the plan you have to enter how many shares are allowed per subscription.

   It generates special coupon that others can use to get 100% discount.

Simple but powerful isn't it?
